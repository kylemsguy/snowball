Hi all,


Next week's BME205 tutorial (Jan. 23) is canceled due to the EngSci Education Conference. If you want, you can go to the Tuesday/Thursday tutorials but you need to email the head TA Gabrielle Lam (gabrielle.lam@mail.utoronto.ca )


You will all be awarded the attendence mark regardless if you choose to attend the Tuesday/Thursday sessions.

... which is likely to become something of a "pre-midterm" session, will take place in BA2195 from 1100-1300. I had completely missed that there are March Break events happening tomorrow, but luckily there is still space and time. As a reminder, this is targeting students whose Thursday lecture was cancelled. Note that there will be no new content covered.

A final reminder that Writing Assignment #1 is due today at 12 noon to turn-it-in. Specific information about submission can be found on the assignment statement. 


Also, unfortunately I have to cancel our lecture today at 1:00 due to family illness. At this point, I'm going to assume I'll be able to lecture tomorrow, and then we'll fill in any gaps with a screencast. Please accept my most sincere apologies. 


One note about the reading this week - the required reading is chapters 6 and 7 from the book, although I will say that chapter 7 will align more with our themes next week. We assigned both chapters this week as putting both Chapters 7 and 8 next week would make for a lot of reading in one week. If you are leading the student-lead reading discussion, you might consider focusing on chapter 6 or other themes raised in the book between chapters 1 and 5, however if you've already planned for chapter 7 please proceed. 


Best

Hello EngSci 1T7:
 
Remember that Friday January 17th is the 9th Annual Engineering Science Education Conference(ESEC), and all first year classes have been cancelled in order to accommodate your attendance. You are required to attend at least three lectures (i.e. one of the two parallel lectures in each of three out of the four time-slots) and we understand that you may want to attend the Your Next Career Fair during your free time.  If you are not going to Your Next, then please plan to attend ESEC all day. You must register with your UTORid identification, so be sure to bring your T-card with you. ESEC will be followed by a survey that will be assigned a grade in Praxis. Attendance at ESEC is required in order to complete the survey and earn the mark.
 
Students in past years have been very positive about ESEC and the speakers we have this year are truly outstanding. We have enlisted nine elite researchers and professionals from academia and industry to present you with the latest research and to provide a snapshot of what is going on in each field.  The ESEC lectures will help you to make the best possible decision about your Option in third year.  Let the conference help you to identify the type of engineer, scientist, or professional you aspire to become.
 
Speaker biographies, abstracts, and the schedule are also available on the website: https://my.engsci.utoronto.ca/esec/
 
Sincerely,
 
ESEC 2014 Executive Committee
