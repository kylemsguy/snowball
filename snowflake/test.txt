Next week's BME205 tutorial (Jan. 23) is canceled due to the EngSci Education Conference. If you want, you can go to the Tuesday/Thursday tutorials but you need to email the head TA Gabrielle Lam (gabrielle.lam@mail.utoronto.ca ) You will all be awarded the attendence mark regardless if you choose to attend the Tuesday/Thursday sessions.
